		<h4>Why does this site exist?</h4>
		<p>This site exists to provide a leaderboard for speedrunners who utilize Turbo buttons when playing Metroid Dread. For some, this is to reduce strain on their hands in certain circumstances requiring button mashing.</p>

		<h4>Can I only submit a run if I am using a turbo button?</h4>
		<p>Nope! Anyone can submit on this leaderboard, regardless of whether or not they want to use a turbo button.</p>

		<h4>How can I get started?</h4>
		<p>Please head over to our <a href="submit.html">submissions page</a> and follow the instructions to submit a run.</p>

		<h4>If I've submitted to another leaderboard website, can I submit here as well?<h4>
		<p>Absolutely!</p>

		<h4>How are you verifying runs, anyways?</h4>
		<p>Short answer, we aren't currently. We are using the honour system at the moment unless this site becomes popular enough, or someone decides to cheat and ruin this for everyone. <strong>Please don't be the reason we have to start verifying runs.</strong></p>

		<h4>Who are you?</h4>
		<p>A toaster</p>

		<h4>This site looks like garbage</h4>
		<p>That's not a question, but thanks! :) The worst part is I've learned how to use emoji, and now I'm unstoppable in my destruction. &#x1f480;</p>
