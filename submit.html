			<li>Upload or higlight your VOD permanently (If your VOD link becomes unavailable, it will be removed form the leaderboard.</li>

				<li><strong>OPTIONAL:</strong> If you would like, you can also include why accessibility options like the turbo button are important in speedrunning for you, and I may include it on the <a href="about.html">About</a> page.
